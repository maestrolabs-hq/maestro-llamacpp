# maestro-llamacpp

maestro-llamacpp is the estate's model router. It supervises llama.cpp server
processes and exposes one OpenAI-compatible endpoint per model plus a generic
routing endpoint.

Status: the second slice. The router reads and validates a catalog, and takes
one entry from it as far as a running `llama-server` on a loopback port that
answers a health check. It does not route or proxy anything yet -- that
arrives with the later slices the design names.

## Checking a catalog

```sh
model-router check catalog.toml
```

A usable catalog reports what it carries and exits zero:

```text
catalog.toml is valid: 4 models
```

An unusable one names every problem, each by the entry and the field it came
from, and exits non-zero. Every fault is listed rather than only the first, so
one run covers one round of edits:

```text
models.toml is not usable:
  entry 'alpha': field 'colour' is not recognised
  entry 'alpha': field 'path' is required
  entry 'alpha': field 'context_size' must be greater than zero, but is 0
  entry 'beta': field 'residency' must be one of resident or on-demand, but is 'sometimes'
```

`catalog.toml` holds the models this router serves. Every location in it is
relative to a models root supplied at run time, so the file describes a set of
models without naming the machine they sit on.

## Launching one model

```sh
model-router launch catalog.toml gemma3
```

Starts that entry, waits until it answers, then stops it again:

```text
gemma3 is ready at http://127.0.0.1:41273 after 1.4 seconds
gemma3 stopped
```

This is deliberately not a long-running command. Staying up until interrupted
needs a signal handler for no gain in a slice with nothing to serve; launching,
proving readiness and stopping is the whole of what this slice claims.

A child that never becomes ready fails when its startup budget expires, and a
child that exits while loading fails with its status rather than waiting the
budget out. Every failure names the entry it came from.

### Where the models are

Catalog locations are relative, and resolve against a models root read at run
time:

| Source | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `MAESTRO_MODELS_ROOT` | used as given, when set and not empty |
| otherwise | `models` under the home directory |

The server binary is located rather than bundled: `llama-server` is taken from
the search path, with the platform's executable suffix, so no tracked file
names one machine.
