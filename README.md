# maestro-llamacpp

maestro-llamacpp is the estate's model router. It supervises llama.cpp server
processes and exposes one OpenAI-compatible endpoint per model plus a generic
routing endpoint.

Status: bootstrapped. The repository builds, is linted and gated, and carries
no router behaviour yet -- `model-router` reports that no commands are
implemented and exits non-zero.

## Documents
